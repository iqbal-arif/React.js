1. Attribute expressions
   Last updated June 2022

---

JSX also supports attribute expressions which means the value of the attribute will be based on an expression (or most often a variable), for example:

```const limit = 5;

const element = <input type="number" max={limit} />;
```

When converted to React.createElement(), it will look like this:

```const limit = 5;
const element = React.createElement("input", {
  type: "number",
  max: limit
});
```

This example shows how properties can have string values as well as dynamic values; for example, the max property takes the value of the variable limit.

2. Quotes OR Expression

---

It's important to note that you should either put quotes for the attribute value OR use curly braces to have an expression with curly braces, but not both.

So this is invalid: <input max="{limit}" />, it will NOT work.

Instead, it should have been: <input max={limit} />

The rule of thumb is:

---

    1. If the value is a string, then wrap it with quotes.
    2 .If the value is dynamic (the result of an expression), then wrap it with curly braces {}.

We will see more complicated examples in the next lesson, where you'd like to mix both strings and dynamic values.
Numbers and booleans

Number and boolean attribute values should be passed as an expression:

```<input max={2} disabled={true} className="textbox" />

```

Recap

    If the value of the attribute is a string, then wrap it with quotes
    If the value of the attribute is an expression, then wrap it with curly braces {}
    Number and boolean attribute values should be passed as an expression

/\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***/
