8. Chapter recap 
Last updated July 2022

It's sometimes hard to remember the big picture, so let's take a step back and see why we're using React and how it's helping us.

```
import {useState} from "react";
import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client";

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (<>
        <div>{count} times clicked!</div>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Add 1</button>
    </>);
}
createRoot(document.querySelector("#root")).render(<Counter />);
```
The benefit of using React here is that we return <div>{count} times clicked!</div>, and we do NOT have to worry about the updates.
We call setCount() and React will worry about the {count} value in <div>{count} times clicked!</div>.

Typically with Vanilla JavaScript (JavaScript without any library), you'd have to manually update the DOM every time a variable changes, and that could quickly become messy as the requirements get more advanced.

Chapter recap
****
1. ***onClick={() => console.log("Hello World")}*** is a click event that works on a <button> and logs "Hello World"
2. You always have to use the 'set' function that you get back from useState (for example, setSeconds, setCount)
3. When you change the state, React will call the Component function again to re-render
4. The initialValue passed to useState(initialValue) is only used the first time a Component renders.
5. useState is a React Hook that hooks into the internals of React and notifies it that a state variable has changed.
