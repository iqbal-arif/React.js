Breaking down useState 

Last updated June 2022

Now that we learned about both values returned by useState we can break down how it works:

```
import {useState} from "react";

function Stopwatch() {
    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);
    console.log("value of seconds is: ", seconds);

    return (<>
        <h2>{seconds}</h2>
        <button onClick={() => setSeconds(seconds + 1)}>Click to add 1</button>
    </>);
}
```

The first time this Component renders, we will get the following console log:
```
value of seconds is: 0 // it uses the default value passed to useState, which is 0
Then when the user clicks on the button, we set the seconds' new value to seconds + 1, so 0 + 1 = 1
```
Because we called setSeconds, React knows that this Component's state has changed, which means it needs to re-render, so the whole Stopwatch function is called again, but this time the seconds state has already been created so it will not be set to 0.
React will NOT use the initial value anymore because the state already exists.

So this time, const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0) actually gives the state seconds which has a value of 1.

Why? Because we previously called setSeconds(1).

So here's the console log that we see when React re-renders this Component:

```
value of seconds is: 1 // that's what we set it to when we called setSeconds(1)
Then when the user clicks on the button, we set the seconds' new value to seconds + 1, so 1 + 1 = 2
```

Recap
*****
1. When you change the state, React will call the Component function again to re-render
2. The initialValue passed to useState(initialValue) is only used the first time a Component renders.
