SetState

Why do we need a dedicated method to update the state?

In short, React will not be able to know if you change the value of seconds, so we need to use the method provided which is setSeconds.
This method will hook into the internals of React and notify it that we are changing the value of a state (hence why useState is a hook, more on that in a dedicated chapter).

This often means that the Component has to re-render, which means it has to be re-drawn on the screen, which is taken care of by ReactDOM.

Recap
***
1. useState is a React Hook that hooks into the internals of React and notifies it that a state variable has changed.
