You may have noticed that we've been asking you to import React every time you use React.createElement; that's because we'd like to make sure you understand this concept and get used to it.

Eventually, this becomes boring, so we'll make it easier for you later in this course.

React.createElement is quite a long syntax. However, it's the foundation for JSX. What is JSX, and how does it work? Let's find out in the next chapter.

This is your first chapter recap! You can save it to your notes by clicking on the + icon on the top-right of the recap.

    1. ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM.
    2. ReactDOM is separate from React
    3. ReactDOM can be installed with npm install react-dom
    4. Import ReactDOM's createRoot method with import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client"
    5. createRoot(root).render(element);
    6. Reconciliation is the process of syncing the Virtual DOM to the actual DOM.
    7. ReactDOM completely manages the root element.
    8. You should not directly change/update the content of the root element.
