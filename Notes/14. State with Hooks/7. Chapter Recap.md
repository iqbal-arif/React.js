Chapter recap

Great work!

In this chapter, we only learned how to create and use state in JSX.
In the next one, we'll learn how to update and how React automatically re-renders the Component.

Also, it's important to not create state variables when they can be computed from a prop value.

Here's a bad example that you should avoid:

```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Products(props) {
    const { productsList } = props;
    // ❌ Unnecessarily complicated
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        setCount(productsList.length);
    }, [productsList]);

    return <p>Number of products: {count}</p>;
}
```
We don't need to create a state variable because we can directly compute that from the props:

```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Products(props) {
    const { productsList } = props;
    // ✅ compute it from the props
    const count = productsList.length;

    return <p>Number of products: {count}</p>;
}
```

Recap
***

1. State refers to any variable defined inside a Component with the intent to update later on.
2. State variables can be updated from inside the Component.
3. When a state variable is updated, the Component automatically re-renders.
4. useState allows us to create a state variable in a Component
5. useState is a named export that needs to be imported
6. You can import useState and React: import React, {useState} from "react";
7. useState is one of many React Hooks.
8. The useState() function takes the initial_value as the only argument.
9. The useState() function returns an array of 2 items
10.Always destructure the useState into abc and setAbc where abc is the name of the state
11.The default value of the state variable returned by useState will be the same as the initial_value passed to useState().
