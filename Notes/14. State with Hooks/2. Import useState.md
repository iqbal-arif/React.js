Import useState
Last updated June 2022

Let's start by creating our first state variable.
To do that we need to import the useState function from the "react" package.

useState is a named export which means the syntax for importing it is:

import {useState} from "react";

If you were already importing React in the same file, you can merge the imports into a single one. For example:

import React from "react";
import {useState} from "react";

The above can be combined into a single import:

import React, {useState} from "react";

The syntax may look weird at first, but remember that:

    React is a default export (no curly braces)
    useState is a named export (wrapped in curly braces)

useState is a React Hook

useState is one of many hooks provided by React.
We won't be covering what Hook means for now, but a detailed explanation will follow in the next few chapters.
