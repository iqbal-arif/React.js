1. Working with JSX
   Last updated June 2022

---

Since JSX is being converted into a React.createElement(...) that returns an object, you can essentially think of a JSX element as if it were an object.
So you can think of <h1 className="title">Supermarket</h1> as being an object that more or less looks like this (simplified):

```{
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: "title",
    children: "Supermarket"
  }
}
```

As a reminder, this object is a representation of a piece of your UI that React maintains in its Virtual DOM.
This lets it efficiently know when it got updated, and then it re-renders it using ReactDOM.

Since <h1 className="title">Supermarket</h1> is an object, then you can treat it as an object.
This is why you can:

1. Assign it to a variable:

```const title = <h1 className="title">Supermarket</h1>;

```

2. Return it from a function

```function getTitle() {
    return <h1 className="title">Supermarket</h1>
}
```

3. Conditionally return different elements:

```function getTitle(is_open) {
    if (is_open) {
        return <h1 className="title">Supermarket</h1>
    } else {
        return <h1 className="title">Supermarket (closed)</h1>
    }
}
```

4. Other things you can normally do. It's a call to React.createElement(...).

This may be obvious to some people, but we thought we'd spend some time on it to make sure you understand it because it takes some time to get used to the JSX syntax.

To help you further visualise this, the last example you saw above (getTitle), gets transformed to the following code:

```function getTitle(is_open) {
  if (is_open) {
    return React.createElement("h1", {
      className: "title"
    }, "Supermarket");
  } else {
    return React.createElement("h1", {
      className: "title"
    }, "Supermarket (closed)");
  }
};
```

You may realize that there's a lot of repetition between the code inside the if block and the code inside the else block.
Don't worry; we will get to that in the following chapter!
