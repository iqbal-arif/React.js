Essentially, the difference between Element and Component is that: Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

Another concept we'll learn about is that a component's props should never be modified inside the function.
We will have an entire chapter about it, but first, let's recap this chapter and work on our first project!

Chapter recap

    1. Props is short for properties
    2. Props is an object received as the first argument of a Component
    3. Attributes on Components get converted into an object called Props
    4. props.children represents the content between the tags of a Component.
    5. props.children can be an array or a single item.
    6. props.children can contain text and/or React Elements and/or React Components.
    7. Props are an object, so you can destructure them.
