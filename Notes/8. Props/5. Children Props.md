1. Children props
   Last updated June 2022

---

We've seen so far that props represent attributes on a Component.
There's a special type of props for children. Let's take an example:

```
const element = <HeroTitle>Welcome!</HeroTitle>
```

The content that goes between the <HeroTitle> and </HeroTitle> tags is called the children props.

You can access it with props.children, for example:

```
function HeroTitle(props) {
    return <h1 className="hero">{props.children}</h1>;
}
```

This example of props.children is a string ("Welcome!"), but in fact, it could be anything else as well.

2. Not just text

---

props.children could refer to other React Elements or even Components (also multiple Components); here's an example:

```function Navbar(props){
    return <div className="navbar">{props.children}</div>;
}

const element = <Navbar>
    <HeroTitle>Welcome!</HeroTitle>
    <div>Some content</div>
    <p>Another content</p>
</Navbar>;

In this example, props.children would be an array containing these 3 items:

    <HeroTitle>Welcome!</HeroTitle>
    <div>Some content</div>
    <p>Another content</p>

Even though props.children is an array, the end result of the element is:

<div class="navbar">
    <h1 class="hero">Welcome!</h1>
    <div>Some content</div>
    <p>Another content</p>
</div>

As you can see, the navbar is wrapping all the children it receives.
Keep an eye on this pattern, as we'll see it later with the UI Kit and React router.
Recap

    props.children represents the content between the tags of a Component.
    props.children can be an array or a single item.
    props.children can contain text and/or React Elements and/or React Components.
