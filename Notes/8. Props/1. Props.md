1. Props
   Last updated May 2023

---

Say we've got a component called <GreetUser> that says: Welcome Sam or Welcome Alex.
As you can see, we need to make it say Welcome and then the user's name.

Let's start by writing a basic hard-coded version of this component:

```//GreetUser.js
export default function GreetUser() {
    return <div>Welcome USER</div>;
}
```

This component <GreetUser /> now displays Welcome USER.

2. Props to the rescue

---

Instead of rendering <GreetUser />, we can render <GreetUser user="Sam" />.

This user="Sam" is an attribute user with a value Sam that we've added to our GreetUser component.

Now we can read this user="Sam" as an object: {user: "Sam"}.
We call that object props (which is short for properties).

```//GreetUser.js
export default function GreetUser(props) {
    console.log(props); // {user: "Sam"}
    return <div>Welcome USER</div>;
}
```

As you can see, the attribute we passed is now inside the object that the GreetUser function receives as a first argument.
So we can use an expression to render the user's name (which we can read as props.user):

```//GreetUser.js
export default function GreetUser(props) {
    return <div>Welcome {props.user}</div>;
}
```

    1. <GreetUser user="Sam"/> would render <div>Welcome Sam</div>
    2. <GreetUser user="Alex"/> would render <div>Welcome Alex</div>

This makes our component more reusable!

3. React.createElement

---

The following JSX code:

```<GreetUser user="Sam" id="2" />

```

gets transformed into:

```React.createElement(GreetUser, {user: "Sam", id: "2"});

```

Notice how the JSX attributes on Components get converted into props as the second argument of React.createElement.

Recap

    1. Props is short for properties.
    2. Props is an object received as the first argument of a Component.
    3. Attributes on Components get converted into an object called Props.
    4. Props make components more reusable.
