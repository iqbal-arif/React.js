1. Self-closing tags
   Last updated June 2022

HTML has some self-closing tags, which are HTML tags that cannot contain children; thus, they do not need a closing tag.

An example of a self-closing tag is the img because an <img /> cannot contain children.

Here's a list of the most common self-closing tags in HTML:

    1. img
    2. br (line break)
    3. hr (horizontal rule)
    4. input

In HTML, you can either write these elements as self-closing or as a normal element, for example:

```<br>
<br />
```

Both variations are valid in HTML5.

In JSX, you cannot open an element without closing it, thus it's recommended that you use the self-closing tag syntax:

```const image = <img src="image.png" />

```

This will be especially useful later on once we work with Components.
