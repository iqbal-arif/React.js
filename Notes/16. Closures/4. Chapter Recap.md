Chapter recap 
Last updated June 2022
***
We learned about closures because as we work with Events & State, we will need to have event handlers that can access our state.
In a nutshell, we need to be able to write code like this:

```
import {useState} from "react";

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    function handleIncrementClick() {
        setCount(count + 1);
    }
    
    return (<>
        <div>{count} times clicked</div>
        <button onClick={handleIncrementClick}>Add 1</button>
    </>);
}
```
This will be fully explained in the next chapter, but for now, notice how handleIncrementClick is a function defined inside the Counter function.
And notice how the handleIncrementClick function has access to the count state variable because it's defined inside Counter.

This is why we need to know about closures :)

To recap Closures in one sentence:

It's when a function contains another function, the inner function gains access to the outer function's variables.

Chapter recap
***
1. A closure is where an inner function has access to the outer function's variables.
2. Functions defined inside another function can use the variables defined in the outer function.
3. Closures are useful when working with React Components
