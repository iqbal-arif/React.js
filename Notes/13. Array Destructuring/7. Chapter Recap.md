Chapter recap
Last updated March 2023
***
As you can see, array destructuring is just syntactic sugar as it makes it easier for us to create variables out of elements of an array.
You may have also noticed that returning an array from a function lets us return several variables (which could also be of different types).

This concept is available in many programming languages. Still, it is also a prerequisite for React Hooks, which we'll be diving into over the next few chapters!

I hope you're excited!

Recap
***
   1. Array destructuring is a shorter syntax for creating variables out of the items of an array.
   2. Array destructuring works regardless of the data types in the array.
   3. You can destructure from a function, assuming the function is returning an array of elements
