1. Multiple classes

---

Another common use case is when working with multiple class names, for example:

```
const clickable = "clickable";
const active = "active";

const button = <button className={clickable + " " + active}>Click me</button>;
```

Which can also be written using template strings:

```
const button = <button className={`${clickable} ${active}`}>Click me</button>;
```

Later in this course, we will see clsx, which is a tiny library (< 0.5kb) that makes it easier to deal with multiple conditional classes.

Recap

    1. When an attribute is partially dynamic, then treat it as being entirely dynamic
    2. You can use either template strings (with interpolation) or string concatenation.
