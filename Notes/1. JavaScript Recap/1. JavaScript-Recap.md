JavaScript concepts

---

When writing React applications, you will use a lot of JavaScript concepts, such as:

    const/let
    Template strings
    Arrays/Objects
    Array methods (filter, find, etc.)
    Spread operator
    array/object destructuring
    import/export
    arrow functions
    lexical scope
    Immutability
    Promises
    Fetch API
    and more

You will have a short recap of the non-trivial concepts (in bold) before you start using them with React.
