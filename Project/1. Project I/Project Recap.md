Great job!

You've built your first UI kit out of React Components.

There are some limitations to this kind of UI Kit, for example:

    1. What if we need to make the <Input /> disabled? We did not make it support the disabled attribute
    2. What about other attributes that we didn't think about?
    3. What about the massive amount of code duplicating the props into attributes?
    4. How do we create several types of Buttons that differ in terms of design? For example, a Primary one and a  Secondary one?

We will have an answer for you in the following few chapters.
The next chapter will be about Pure Functions which is an important concept that allows React to perform some powerful features
